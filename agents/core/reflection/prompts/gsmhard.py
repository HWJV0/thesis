Observation: The generated answer is 25841028.
Reflection: My reasoning failed because I subtracted the sister's chocolates from Leah's instead of adding them, and then added the eaten chocolates instead of subtracting to find the remaining total. In the future, I should first add Leah's and her sister's chocolates together and then subtract the number eaten to accurately determine the total remaining chocolates. """
